- consider 'failsafe' DataSource
  If all others fail, setting a default that
   - sets the user password, writing it to console
   - logs to console that this happened
- consider 'previous' DataSource
  If no other data source is found, fall back to the 'previous' one
  keep a indication of what instance id that is in /var/lib/cloud
- allow setting of user password and lock account
- move "user-scripts" upstart job to "final", possibly move its
  contents to a managed script in /usr/lib/cloud
- "final" things
 - messags to console
   - failsafe warning
   - ssh keys
   - password (if set above)
 - post system info home
- rewrite "cloud-init-query"
  have DataSource and cloudinit expose explicit fields
   - instance-id
   - hostname
   - mirror
   - release
   - ssh public keys
