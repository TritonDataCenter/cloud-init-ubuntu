=== General Info ===
Development packaging branch is at
   lp:ubuntu/<suite>/cloud-init
alternatively, if you're on the development release:
   lp:ubuntu/cloud-init

Patches in debian/patches are also stored applied in bzr.
However, the .pc directory is not version controlled.

When you've done a fresh checkout of above, you will need to run:
   debian/rules quilt-setup

To cherry pick revisions 391 to tip from from trunk, do something like:
  s=391; e=;
  b=../trunk;
  [ -n "${e}" ] || e=$(cd ${b} && bzr revno)
  pfile=catchup-${s}${e:+-${e}}.patch
  [ "$s" = "$e" ] && pfile=catchup-${s}.patch
  ( cd ../trunk && bzr log -r$s..$e &&
      bzr diff -p1 -r$(($s-1))..$e ) > "debian/patches/$pfile"
  echo "$pfile" >> debian/patches/series
  quilt push
  bzr add $(quilt files) debian/patches/${pfile} debian/patches/series

You can set 'e' (end) to not go to tip.
